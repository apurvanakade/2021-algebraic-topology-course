\maketitle 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item You must type your solutions in \LaTeX. Feel free to ask for help on Discord, especially if \LaTeX{} is new to you.
    \item If you need to include pictures, feel free to put all your pictures on a separate page and append them at the end. The pictures do not have to be polished or drawn using \LaTeX. Hand-drawn pictures are totally fine. 
    \item Start the solution for each question on a new page. (Just use the \verb|\newpage| command).
    \item You'll have to upload your solutions on \url{gradescope.ca} (accessible through OWL).
    \item You must provide detailed justifications for all your answers. Points will be assigned for details and not ideas.
    \item There will be no deadline extensions. Note that the lowest HW grade will be dropped.
    \item You're encouraged to discuss the problems with other students but you must write your own solutions. Even googling for solutions counts as a violation of academic integrity.
